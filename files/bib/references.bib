  abstract = {Objective statistical information is vital to an open and democratic society. It provides a solid foundation so that informed decisions can be made by our elected representatives, businesses, unions, and non-profit organizations, as well as individual citizens. There is a great shift towards a more virtual and digital economy and society. The traditional official statistical systems are centered on surveys, and must be adapted to this new digital reality. National statistical offices have been increasingly embracing non-survey data sources along with data science methods to better serve society.This paper provides a blueprint for the application of data science in a government organization. It describes how data science enables innovation and the delivery of new high-value, high-quality, relevant, and trusted products that reflect the ever-evolving needs of our society and economy. We discuss practical operational considerations and impactful data science applications that supported the work of Statistics Canada's analysts and front-line health agencies during the pandemic. We also discuss the innovative use of scanner data in lieu of survey data for large business respondents in the retail industry. We will describe computer vision methodologies, including machine learning models used to detect the start of buildings construction from satellite imagery, greenhouse area and greenhouse production, as well as crop types detection. Data science and machine learning methods have tremendous potential, and their ethical use is of primary importance. We conclude the paper with a forward-facing view of responsible data science use in statistical production.},

  abstract = {A low level of capital to support workers is a key cause of the UK's low labour productivity. We estimate that for each hour worked, people in the UK benefit from a third less capital than workers in higher-productivity peer countries (the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands). This is the first rigorous quantification of the UK's capital gap, and we estimate that it was around {\pounds}2 trillion in 2019 in absolute terms. This estimate varies depending on the assets in scope and the data used, demonstrating the significant challenges associated with estimating internationally comparable productive capital stocks per hour worked. Nevertheless, we are confident that the UK's capital gap is measured in the trillions of pounds. In this context, the government's current level of ambition for raising UK investment---which frequently talks about tens of billions---is far too low. Even if the UK was able to step up its investment rate by about 4\%-points of GDP, it would take almost a century to catch up with the capital intensity of higher-productivity peer countries. Marginal increases to public investment combined with minor initiatives to encourage private investment are a distraction, and do not constitute a strategic take on the issue. A clear, credible and coordinated push is necessary to dislodge the UK from its low productivity/low capital stock equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Mail surveys have long been a staple of social science research. Properly conducted, they can gather representative data about a population that provides important generalizations about that population. High response rates are one crucial element of this capacity to make such generalizations. Response rates to mail surveys--especially those targeting general populations--have declined substantially over the years, even when employing standard ``best practices'' such as carefully crafted and pretested instruments, good explanations of research purpose, and multiple contacts. Our research group has a unique capacity to speak to declining response rates, having implemented mail surveys on natural resource-related topics--using relatively similar methods--for more than 45 years. We present the results of a longitudinal analysis of response rates to 191 surveys we conducted between 1971 and 2017 (response rates and methodological specifics carefully recorded over this time), documenting the changes in response rates over the years, and the factors associated with these changes. Variables assessed include topic saliency, the nature of the sample, timing, length and complexity of the questionnaire, and others. We find that year of implementation is a strong predictor of response rate, net of these other factors. We use these findings as a base from which to engage a larger discussion about strategies that social science researchers might use, both in terms of continued modifications to mail survey approaches and in moving towards other research methods.},

Using detailed survey data on the business practices and information technology investments of 179 large publicly traded firms, we find that firms that adopt DDD have output and productivity that is 5-6\% higher than what would be expected given their other investments and information technology usage.  Furthermore, the relationship between DDD and performance also appears in other performance measures such as asset utilization, return on equity and market value.  Using instrumental variables methods, we find evidence that the effect of DDD on the productivity do not appear to be due to reverse causality.  Our results provide some of the first large scale data on the direct connection between data-driven decision making and firm performance.},

  abstract = {The emergence of big data has stimulated enormous investments into business analytics solutions, but large-scale and reliable empirical evidence about the business value of big data and analytics (BDA) remains scarce. This article presents the results of an econometric study that analyzes the direction, sign, and magnitude of the relationship between BDA and firm performance based on objective measurements of BDA assets. Using a unique panel data set that contains detailed information about BDA solutions owned by 814 companies during the time frame from 2008 to 2014, on the one hand, and their financial performance, on the other hand, we estimate the relationship between BDA assets and firm productivity and find that live BDA assets are associated with an average of 3--7 percent improvement in firm productivity. Yet we also find substantial differences in returns from BDA when we consider the industry in which a firm operates. While firms in information technology-intensive or highly competitive industries are clearly able to extract value from BDA assets, we did not detect measurable productivity improvement for firms outside these industry groups. Taken together, our findings provide robust empirical evidence for the business value of BDA, but also highlight important boundary conditions.},
