  Too cool not to share

The [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS) produces most of the macroeconomic statistics for the UK and I was delighted to discover recently that they had been working on an API.

There are so many good reasons for an ONS API to exist. They recently launched a new website and finding the data you want can be tricky - but a stable API can solve that. An API also seems like the best practice data delivery method in their case. It means that end-users of ONS data can get the latest releases <em>directly</em> from their code rather than having to download a separate file. Given that the files downloaded from the ONS website are not always machine readable out of the box, the API option is a big help.

You can find more about the ONS API on their dedicated [website](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/office-for-national-statistics-api/reference).

But if you just want to get started right away, here's a tiny bit of code which grabs a time series given its code:

```python
import requests
import os
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ------- Functions -----------------------------------------------------------
def grab_ONS_time_series_data(dataset_id,timeseries_id):
    """
    This function grabs specified time series from the ONS API.

    """
    api_endpoint = "https://api.ons.gov.uk/"
    api_params = {
    'dataset':dataset_id,
    'timeseries':timeseries_id}
    url = (api_endpoint
                        +'/'.join([x+'/'+y for x,y in zip(api_params.keys(),api_params.values())][::-1])
                        +'/data')
    return requests.get(url).json()
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Grab the data (put your time series codes here)
data = grab_ONS_time_series_data('MM23','CHMS')

# Check we have the right time series
title_text = data['description']['title']
print("Code output:\n")
print(title_text)
# Put the data into a dataframe and convert types
# Note that you'll need to change months if you're
# using data at a different frequency
df = pd.DataFrame(pd.io.json.json_normalize(data['months']))
# Put the data in a standard datetime format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['value'] = df['value'].astype(float)
df = df.set_index('date')
# Check the data look sensible
print(df.head())
# Plot the data
df['value'].plot(title=title_text,ylim=(0,df['value'].max()*1.2),lw=5.)
plt.show()

```

Here's the plot which comes out:

Pretty neat!
