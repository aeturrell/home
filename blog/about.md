Hi! I'm Vicki. I do data science. I work mostly in Python, R, Spark, and SQL, and really enjoy building end-to-end data products. 

I also like to think about what technology means in the context of society, and write about that, here, as well. 

Talks I've Given Recently: 

+ [Hadoop on Your Laptop](http://veekaybee.github.io/2017/03/20/hadoop-or-laptop/)
+ [SQL for beginners](http://veekaybee.github.io/2017/04/20/sql-is-hard/)
+ Skeptech: [Manuscripts don't burn](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2017/06/19/skeptech/)
+ [Breaking the Internet Bubble](https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/media/breaking-the-internet-bubble)
+ [How to pick a data architecture strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-kbwKX3dus) 


In my spare time, I write, read, run and enjoy Nutella. More at my [main site](http://www.vickiboykis.com).
