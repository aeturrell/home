<h3><b>Firstly, welcome to the first post on this blog...</b></h3>I'm not expecting to post often and I'm not aiming for a particular audience. The blog is more of an experiment in writing about topics which I personally find interesting. If other people happen to find them interesting as well, that's great. Not having any rules for content except that I personally find it interesting could be a recipe for disaster, so the name of the blog is something of a warning too - there may be a lot of jumping around to different topics.<br /><br />Here, I'm starting with transport and energy. People are quite aware of energy use in relation to cars and take into account 'mpg' when buying one. But what about getting around in other modes of transport? I decided to find out and plot the data I could find<sup>[1,2]</sup>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I82RLjtfjnk/Ve8HEH7WqzI/AAAAAAAAAdw/vZqr2o1jmvg/s1600/BP1transp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="468" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I82RLjtfjnk/Ve8HEH7WqzI/AAAAAAAAAdw/vZqr2o1jmvg/s640/BP1transp.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br /></div><br /><br />No suprises for guessing that cars do not come out well in this comparison. Their payload-to-weight ratio is even <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/cars-weigh-too-much">worse</a>. The surprise for me is that light rail does better than even a double-decker bus. The clear winner is the bicycle. This got me wondering, do bicycles win on cost though?<br /><br />At the time of writing, the price of a Zone 1-6 travel card in London is about £2,300 p/a while the price of a decent bicycle is around £300, plus probably another £80 p/a for servicing and replacement parts. The tube is much more convenient over longer distances, but if your workplace is commutable then cycling makes a lot of sense. The other methods of transportation are usually more expensive in absolute terms.<br /><br />Some people worry about the dangers of cycling, and if you've been on the road when there's a lorry bearing down on you, it's easy to understand why. Many of the tragic incidents involving bikes also involve lorries. The health effects of 'invisible' air pollution have also received a lot more attention over the last ten years, with some landmark work being done in the UK<sup>[3]</sup>. Of particular concern is the amount of particulate matter (PM) in the air. Not only are cyclists exposed by being on the road and not in an air-conditioned car, they are likely to be respiring more quickly than someone sat in a private vehicle.<br /><br />A fascinating recent study published in the British Medical Journal<sup>[4]</sup> has looked at the particular case of the London bike hire scheme and the health effects on users of it. They included the effects of injuries and exposure to poor air quality. One sentence stood out:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &quot;interfaceregular&quot; , &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: 30px;">All routes by road transport were associated with much lower exposure to PM2.5 than those reported on the London underground. In aggregate across all trips, the benefit from the averted exposure to PM2.5 in the underground approximately balanced the harms from increased inhalation of pollutants as a result of the higher ventilation rates associated with cycling. Therefore, the impact of cycle hire use on average daily exposure was small.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>The exposure to that particularly damaging pollutant seems to have a limited effect relative to travelling on the tube then. What about the chance of injuries? It seems that cycling does give you a much higher chance of sustaining a serious injury than getting the tube, the bus, or even walking. But the <i>overall </i>health outcomes of cycling in the bike scheme were positive because of the health benefits of the exercise.<br /><br />Although that study was aimed at the bike hire scheme, another report by Transport for London<sup>[5]</sup> concluded that cycling in general was worth £160 per year per person (in 2008 GBP) in health benefits and productivity gains - with some assumptions.<br /><br />For many shorter urban journeys it seems that if you need to get around, it's best to get on your bike.<br /><br /><br />[1] Stephen Potter. <i>Transport energy and emissions: urban public transport</i>.
