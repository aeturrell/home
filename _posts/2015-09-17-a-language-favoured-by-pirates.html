<br />I've been dabbling with R recently. I wanted to make a choropleth, &nbsp;a way of showing data superimposed onto a map. I thought I would have a go at doing it in Python initially but, disappointingly, this is one area in which Python hasn't quite caught up with the competition. I'm sure it'll happen eventually.<br /><br />R was entirely new to me when I started this mini project, so it's interesting to play around with it. It requires just a few lines of code to get something that looks good, but I couldn't in all honesty say that it was intuitive.<br /><br />Living in London, it's been hard not to notice the increases in house prices over the last few years. For a bit of fun, I thought I'd plot the % change in median house price year-on-year. House price data for all the London boroughs are from&nbsp;<a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/">http://data.london.gov.uk/</a>&nbsp;and my spatial data is from&nbsp;<a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london">http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london</a>. There seems to be a good number of free spatial mapping files around on the internet, and the move toward releasing data across all fields of endeavour mean that there's never been a better time to try plotting some of this stuff.<br /><br />My&nbsp;choropleth&nbsp;is shown below.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iundFGvIMRE/VfpSKgSAZnI/AAAAAAAAAeE/Pa0rfUEDs30/s1600/medpricechg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iundFGvIMRE/VfpSKgSAZnI/AAAAAAAAAeE/Pa0rfUEDs30/s640/medpricechg.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Clearly, my code has some issues - so I haven't put it on here. It would be good to get rid of that font size display in the legend.&nbsp;<a href="http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/63040_5ad6d00e5dde4a8588ee07e8edc7b870.html">Check out this</a>&nbsp;much more impressive use of the Metropolitan Police's <a href="http://maps.met.police.uk/tables.htm">data</a>, including an example very similar to mine but focusing on robbery rather than house prices.</div>
