title: The explosion in time series forecasting packages in data science
categories: [code, data science, python, time series]
---

There have been a series of sometimes jaw-dropping developments in data science in the last few years, with large language models by far the most prominent (and with good reason). But another story has been the huge explosion in time series packages.

Were you really a tech firm circa 2020--2023 if you didn't release your own time series package? Looking at what's available and from who, maybe not: Facebook/Meta got the ball rolling with Prophet, but since then we've seen ones from Uber, LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, and Meta again. And it's not hard to see why time series forecasting might be so valuable at these digital-first, data-rich firms. Just as with data orchestration tools, everyone else is seeing some benefit from their labours.

In the rest of this post, we'll look at the new(ish) time series packages that are around, who built them, and what they might be good for.

## Background

Of course, all of this began, at least in my mind, with Meta's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). This provided a quick solution to structural time series modelling out of the box. And it responded well to the needs of those with high frequency data by using Python's [holidays](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) package to allow for holiday fixed effects. Being able to deal with hourly and daily data is crucial to tech firms inundated with data, so it's easy to see why this was built in. And when the pandemic hit, and everything was changing day by day (sometimes exponentially), everyone else was suddenly interested in high-frequency data too.

Prophet has had some criticism, even getting [some blame](https://ryxcommar.com/2021/11/06/zillow-prophet-time-series-and-prices/) for [Zillow's struggles with property trading](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-happened-at-zillow-how-a-prized-real-estate-site-lost-at-ibuying/). But I think it's a bit unfair because Prophet moved data science forecasting on considerably: it performed well out of the box in a wide variety of situations and had support for high-frequency data that didn't exist in many other packages at the time. In short, it's actually a great package, and has become a kind of reference point for every other time series package‚Äîand it seems like it did start something.

Perhaps the [forecasting competitions](https://mofc.unic.ac.cy/) and appearances of websites like papers with code, which has a [time series forecasting](https://paperswithcode.com/task/time-series-forecasting) section, is driving innovation here too, alongside the aforementioned interest in actually using these tools in a business context.

Either way, data scientists are benefitting: the explosion hasn't just been in the number of time series packages (which may not be adding much!), but in the number of methods on offer too. In particular, some of the latest machine learned-based time series forecasting methods are making it into the packages alongside classic methods such as ARIMA. This is quite a contrast from five or ten years ago when most people were relying on one or two approaches in a handful of packages, mostly [**statsmodels**](https://www.statsmodels.org/) in Python and [**forecast**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast) plus a couple of others in R. Of course, new doesn't necessarily mean better, but the innovation and choice are welcome, and it's almost certainly easier now to find a time series forecasting tool that has good performance on your problem.

It's worth saying that while these new packages bring lots that is good, like state of the art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) models, and super modern fast fitting algorithms, their understandable focus on the needs of tech firms can mean they're less well-suited, at least out of the box, to lower frequency data.

## The packages

So what does the landscape look like today? Well, of course, it depends on where we draw the line. Anything that can predict a number can be used for time series forecasting, so all of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) would qualify. But we're going to focus on packages that can do competent time series analysis more or less out of the box. Secondly, we're going to focus more on forecasting than, say, classification or anomaly detection‚Äîthough a lot of the libraries below offer these features too. Similarly, more time series feature discovery packages ([featuretools](https://github.com/alteryx/featuretools), [tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh)) have appeared, but we won't cover those. Finally, I also ignored packages that didn't seem to be under active development or being maintained.

Let's dive into what's on offer now for *time series forecasting*. The table below gives the name, organisation, and homepage of each package. The "About" column is largely drawn from the websites of these packages, with some extra context in italics.

As you can see from the table, we're spoiled for choice right now. I guess you could say, for data scientists doing forecasting, times are good üòâ.

| Package | Organisation | About |
|---|---|---|
| [statsforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) | Nixtla | *This seems highly optimised for speed*. StatsForecast offers a collection of widely used univariate time series forecasting models, including automatic ARIMA, ETS, CES, and Theta modeling optimized for high performance using numba. It also includes a large battery of benchmarking models. Some other claimed features are: fastest implementations of a bunch of algorithms; compatibility with Spark, Dask, and Ray; confidence intervals; support for exogenous variables; 500x faster than prophet; and 20x faster than pmdarima. |

It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.‚Äù |
