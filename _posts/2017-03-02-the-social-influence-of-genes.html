<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">It's no surprise that beliefs and behaviours shared
within social groups mean that one individual's preferences can influence
outcomes for another individual. The Ising model, appropriated from physics,
has been deployed to capture economic herding due to social influence (a short
review may be&nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/77/6/062001/meta">found
here</a>&nbsp;(Â£) or&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0243">here on the
arXiv</a>), while network theory has been used to get at the wider system of
bilateral relationships between individuals. Schelling's model of segregation,
though simple, shows how local social preferences can lead to effects which
manifest at the macro level. Social effects are important. But what drives social
influence? The need to 'fit-in'? That's surely part of it. But it may also have
an underlying genetic component.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">A fascinating recent&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006498">paper
in PLoS One</a>&nbsp;measures the&nbsp;<i>social&nbsp;</i>influence due to
genetics. They showed that the specific genetic makeup of one mouse has an
effect on the outcomes (for instance, wound healing rate) of another mouse
sharing the same cage. They call these phenomena social genetic effects (SGE).
From the abstract,<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">"We find that genetic variation in cage mates
(i.e. SGE) explains up to 29% of the variation in anxiety, wound healing,
immune function, and body weight. Hence our study uncovers an unexpectedly
large influence of the social environment. Additionally, we show that ignoring
SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects (effects of an
individual's genotypes on its own phenotype), which has important implications
for the study of the genetic basis of complex traits."<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">29% is an enormous effect! Would the same effects ever
apply in people? You can imagine situations where they would, at least
qualitatively. Anxiety is easily spread between people: for example,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n9/full/nn1968.html">phobias and
fears can be acquired through observation</a>&nbsp;as well as through direct
experience, as in the&nbsp;<a href="http://insights.ovid.com/abnormal-psychology/jabnp/1986/11/000/immunization-against-observational-conditioning/1/00004468">famous
study</a>&nbsp;where monkeys learned to fear snakes from videos of other
monkeys being afraid of snakes. Immune function is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256323/">heavily dependent
on sleep</a>, and sleep patterns are&nbsp;<a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/24/12/1220.full">heavily dependent on
genetics</a>: if one person has genes which make them more of an 'owl', a
'lark' partner might have their sleep disrupted. It'll be interesting to see if
follow up studies can tease out the size of SGE in people. There may be some
circumstances, eg in health economics, where SGE are an important source of
unobserved heterogeneity.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
